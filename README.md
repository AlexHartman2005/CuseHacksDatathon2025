This was my submission for the CuseHacks 2025 DataThon.

The title was Does Syracuse Really Not Have Parking Tickets?

Generally, the goal was to look through all the parking ticket data and see if Sryracuse has parking ticket quotas for their officers. Generally, the idea is that they issue more parking tickets the later you get into a month

The Python file contians my code for this project and the graphs that were made. If you run it you get every graph and some information in the form of print statements.
There is a PowerPoint presentation included that summarizes the information in the graphs and data.
